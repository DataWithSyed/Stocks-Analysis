# Advanced Stock Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive stock analysis project utilizing Python, focusing on data extraction, visualization, and predictive analytics. The code applies multiple data science and machine learning techniques to gain insights into stock performance, evaluate trends, and make informed predictions. This project is ideal for financial analysts, data scientists, and those interested in quantitative finance.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Extraction and Preparation
- **Stock Data Retrieval**: Extracts historical stock price data for various companies, preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Handles missing values, formats dates, and preprocesses data to ensure consistency.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualizes closing prices over time to identify general market trends.
- **Moving Averages**: Implements short-term (e.g., 20-day) and long-term (e.g., 50-day) moving averages to study momentum and trend strength.
- **Volatility Analysis**: Calculates stock price volatility to assess risk over different timeframes.

### 3. Technical Indicators
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Evaluates stock momentum by comparing the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses.
- **Bollinger Bands**: Analyzes price fluctuations and volatility, indicating potential buy/sell points when the price deviates from the mean.

### 4. Visualization
- **Time-Series Visualization**: Displays historical stock prices and moving averages for visual trend analysis.
- **Candlestick Charts**: Plots OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) data, providing detailed insights into daily price movements.

### 5. Machine Learning for Predictive Analysis
- **Linear Regression**: Uses linear models to forecast stock prices based on historical data trends.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Employs a neural network model for time-series prediction, capturing complex temporal dependencies in stock prices.

## Project Structure

- **Data Collection**: Python scripts for retrieving and preparing stock data.
- **Exploratory Analysis and Feature Engineering**: Notebooks for generating features and performing EDA.
- **Modeling**: Code for building and evaluating predictive models, including visualization of forecasted trends.
- **Results**: Graphs, charts, and summary statistics from analysis and predictions.
